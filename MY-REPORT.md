* Academic Supervisor: [Dr. Fernando Koch](http://www.fernandokoch.me)

## Research Question

How can we provide comprehensive book details (author, publisher, publication year, etc.) instantly when a user provides the book title?

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic
* There are existing APIs and databases, such as Google Books, Open Library, and Goodreads, that provide detailed information about books.
* Challenges include ensuring accurate title matching and handling various title formats across different databases.
* There’s potential to improve user experience by combining AI with book databases to refine search accuracy and provide personalized recommendations.

#### What this research is exploring
* We are building an intelligent system that retrieves book details from databases and APIs by using a simple book title query.
* The research focuses on improving the process of book discovery, by integrating multiple data sources and refining the matching mechanism for book titles.
* We are exploring AI-driven methods to enhance accuracy and speed in retrieving book details.

#### Implications for practice
* It will be easier for users to instantly find relevant book information by simply providing the book title.
* This tool will optimize the process of book discovery for readers, researchers, and libraries by saving time and effort.
* By better understanding user needs, the system can be fine-tuned to provide more relevant and accurate book data.

## Research Method

We are employing algorithms to query book databases and APIs like Google Books and Open Library, focusing on improving title matching techniques and integrating multiple sources for enriched data retrieval.

## Results

Through the research process, we have successfully developed a prototype capable of retrieving key details like the author, publication year, and publisher from a book’s title. The system performs well in recognizing various title formats and has been able to provide accurate book information consistently.

## Further research

Next, we plan to enhance the system’s capabilities by incorporating additional data sources and refining the title-matching algorithms. We also aim to include user-generated content, such as reviews and ratings, and explore personalized book recommendations based on reading preferences.
